**An advanced reinforcement learning project that compares Hill Climbing, Double Deep Q-Networks (DDQN), and a novel hybrid approach to master the classic CartPole balancing problem.**

## 🌟 Overview

This project provides a comparative analysis of different reinforcement learning strategies to solve the `CartPole-v1` environment from OpenAI Gym. The core objective is to train an agent to balance a pole on a moving cart for as long as possible. The repository explores a unique hybrid technique where a simple Hill Climbing algorithm is used to bootstrap a more complex DDQN agent, aiming to accelerate learning and improve final performance.

### ✨ Key Highlights

  - **🎯 Multi-Algorithm Comparison**: Implements and evaluates three distinct RL approaches: Hill Climbing, DDQN, and a Hybrid DDQN + Hill Climbing model.
  - **🚀 Hybrid "Warm-Start"**: Demonstrates how pre-filling a DDQN's replay memory with experiences from a simpler agent can significantly speed up convergence.
  - **📊 In-depth Performance Analytics**: Automatically generates Matplotlib graphs to visually compare the reward and accuracy curves of each model.
  - **🖥️ Live Agent Visualization**: Includes an interactive Pygame window to watch the final trained agent in action, providing a clear visual demonstration of its performance.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

  - Python 3.9 or higher
  - pip package manager
  - Git

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CartPole-Hybrid-RL.git
cd CartPole-Hybrid-RL

# 2️⃣ Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note:** `requirements.txt` should contain:

```
numpy
gym[classic_control]
matplotlib
pygame
torch
```

-----

## 🎯 Usage

To run the entire experiment—training all three models, generating comparison plots, and launching the final visualization—simply execute the main script:

```bash
python code.py
```

**What happens when you run the script:**

1.  **🔧 Training Hill Climbing:** The simple policy is trained first.
2.  **🚀 Training DDQN (from scratch):** The standard DDQN agent learns the task.
3.  **🧠 Training Hybrid DDQN:** The third agent is "pre-warmed" with Hill Climbing data and then trained.
4.  **📊 Displaying Graphs:** Two Matplotlib windows will appear, showing the reward and accuracy comparisons.
5.  **🎥 Live Visualization:** A Pygame window will launch to show the final, best-performing agent (the hybrid model) balancing the pole.

## 🧠 Technical Details

### Model Architectures

  - **Hill Climbing Policy**: A simple linear policy represented by a weight matrix connecting states to actions. It's optimized by adding noise and adopting changes that lead to higher rewards.
  - **Q-Network (for DDQN)**: A PyTorch neural network with:
      - Input Layer: State dimensions (4 for CartPole)
      - Hidden Layers: Two dense layers with 64 neurons each and ReLU activation.
      - Output Layer: Action dimensions (2 for CartPole), producing Q-values for each action.

### Training Methodology

  - **Replay Memory**: The DDQN agents use a `deque` of size 10,000 to store experiences for batched learning.
  - **Optimization**: The DDQN models are trained using the Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss.
  - **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: An epsilon-greedy strategy is used, with epsilon decaying from `1.0` to `0.01` over time.
  - **Hybrid Pre-fill**: Before training the hybrid DDQN, its replay memory is populated by running the trained Hill Climbing agent for 50 episodes. This provides the network with a baseline of moderately successful behavior, preventing it from starting in a state of complete randomness.

## 📦 Dependencies

  - **PyTorch**: The deep learning framework for the DDQN.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical computations and matrix operations.
